## Towers of Hanoi
I learned so much with this project.

Currently the controls for the game are a little laborious for the user, having to type a tower into each input and click sumbit to make every move.
I would love to implement a drag and drop library to make playing the game more enjoyable.  Maybe someday I will do that!

I also have every intention to submit this with Jamsine tests, but ran out of time after implementing the UI.

This is a fantastic first project for the program.
